# Submission Guidelines

</div>

## Submission Overview

- **No formal registration is required** to participate in the challenge.
- **Full evaluation size:** 100 tasks x 10 instances x 1 rollout = 1,000 rollout outputs.
- **Partial submissions are allowed.** Missing rollout instances count as zero in the final score.
- **Multiple checkpoints** from the same team and model family are considered one entry.
- **No cherry-picking rollout results.** Simulation nondeterminism is expected, and different rollouts of the same policy may produce different results for a given instance. Submissions should report the prescribed rollout for each instance rather than selecting the best outcomes across repeated runs, instances, or tasks.
- **Robot configuration must be reproducible.** If you use a custom robot config with `--robot-config`, include the exact YAML/JSON file in your submission package.

## Evaluation Outputs

After running the evaluation script at `OmniGibson/omnigibson/eval/eval.py`, each rollout produces:

<table class="challenge-data-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Metrics JSON</td>
      <td>Episode metrics, including task success score, normalized movement, and simulator time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Rollout MP4</td>
      <td>Video recording of the evaluated trajectory. Run the evaluator with <code>--write-video</code>; rollout videos are required for challenge submissions.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

See [Evaluation and Rules](./evaluation.md) for the evaluation protocol, wrappers, metrics, and command-line options.

## Robot and Wrapper Configuration

Final evaluation must be reproducible from the files you submit. Include the exact evaluation wrapper and robot configuration used to generate your reported results.

- If you use the default robot setup, include the bundled `omnigibson/eval/r1pro.yaml` or clearly state that you used it unchanged.
- If you use a custom robot setup, include the complete robot config passed through `--robot-config`. The file must contain canonical OmniGibson robot fields such as `model`, `name`, `controller_config`, observation settings, sensor settings, and any `eval.camera_sensor_names` needed by the evaluation wrappers or video writer.
- The returned action array from your policy server must match the action space induced by the submitted robot config.
- Custom wrappers must still expose only RGB, depth, and proprioception to the policy for challenge-track evaluation.

    }
    ```

!!! warning "Do not edit evaluation outputs"

    Do not modify the output JSON files or rollout videos in any way.

## Final Model Evaluation

There are two supported ways to submit your model for final evaluation.

<div class="challenge-submission-grid">
  <section>
    <h3>Docker-based evaluation</h3>
    <p><strong>Recommended.</strong> Submit a Docker image that serves your policy. We run OmniGibson outside the container and connect to your policy through the WebSocket policy client.</p>
    <p>The submitted model should run on a single 24GB VRAM GPU. Final evaluation will use GPUs such as RTX 3090, A5000, and TitanRTX.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>IP address-based evaluation</h3>
    <p>Serve your policy yourself and provide an IP address that allows us to query it for evaluation. We only accept IP address-based submissions that expose at least 50 ports for parallel evaluation.</p>
    <p>Common serving options include TorchServe, LitServe, vLLM, NVIDIA Triton, or an equivalent model-serving stack.</p>
  </section>
</div>


!!! note "Submission confidentiality and open source"

    Submitted solutions will remain confidential unless participants explicitly grant permission for disclosure. We strongly encourage open-source submissions, as they help advance reproducible research and accelerate progress in embodied AI.

## Final Submission Package

Your final zip file should contain:

<table class="challenge-data-table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Metrics JSON files</td>
      <td>One JSON file for each rollout performed, up to 1,000 files.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wrapper code</td>
      <td>The <code>.py</code> wrapper used during evaluation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Robot config</td>
      <td>The exact robot <code>.yaml</code> or <code>.json</code> config used during evaluation, including any custom <code>controller_config</code>, sensor settings, observation settings, and <code>eval.camera_sensor_names</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>README</td>
      <td>Instructions for evaluating your policy, including the full evaluator command, wrapper path, robot config path, Docker image details or IP address information. For IP address-based submissions, include at least 50 available ports.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In addition, submit a link through the [submission portal](https://behavior-1k-2026-challenge-leaderboard.hf.space/submit) to all rollout MP4 videos, one for each rollout performed, up to 1,000 videos.
